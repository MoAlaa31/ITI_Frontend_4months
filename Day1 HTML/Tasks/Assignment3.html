<h3>My Dog</h3>

<span>My dog Sasha is my best friend. She likes to chase
the soccer ball when I practice. It is so funny to
see her running down the field trying to catch the
ball with her mouth. It just won't fit!</span>

<p>Once Soha saved my life. When I was only 4 years old, I started to go into the street to get a ball that
hod rolled across the street. Of course I did not think to look for cars! Sasha got in front of me and
knocked me backwards onto the sidewalk. I was mod until I saw the car go by where I would have been.
Then I was so happy that Sasha was smarter than I was!</p>
